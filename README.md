## Bootcamp day 14 Asycn Js

this repo present a challenge to the trainees, they shoul solve the following issues


  1. Fix Issues on Carrousel
  2. every Card on Carrousel must have image
  3. the image must come from the api
  4. if i update the Card on the carrousel (clicking on the left or righ buttons) each new card must have its image

 *you can use UseEffect or UseState to solve the issues on the project*

 ### Issues on Carrousel
 the click event does not update properly the cards, on the first try a double click is needed to go to the next section,
 the page is not in sync with the content, when i am on page "2" i see content of page "1" (counting starts on 0)

 ### images for Cards on Carrousel
 the images comes as response from specific pokemon, so the logic of this exercise depends on the response of the call
 api to get the list of all pokemons, trainees could use function **getInfo** as reference

 **[pokemonApi](https://pokeapi.co/)**
